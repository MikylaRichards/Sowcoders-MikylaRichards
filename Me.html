<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>My name is Mikyla Richards, I am 15 years Old.. I live in Belize City. I really love spending time with my family even though they can be annoying at times , haha, I still enjoy the quality time. My puppy, Bella, she’s my best friend, I love her so much. She is the best company ever and she’s always entertaining. In my free time I enjoy learning new things such as creating a new craft or making rings or even writing poems. I just love adventures and new stuff because there is so much to learn and everyday is a chance to develop a new skill!</p>

<h2> Why did I chose to start this business?</h2>
<p>I chose to start Dinkies because everyone loves Chamoyadas and other refreshing drinks, well in my opinion who doesn’t? So , I decided to create a business that sells refreshing products and in return the customers can be filled with a sense of contribution as they are supporting a worthy cause which is the implementation of safe societies.</p>
