<h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Our mission at Dinkies Cafe is to provide refreshing drinks and pastries for our customers and to also, with every purchase, educate them of the violence that occurs in our community. Our mission is solely to provide a product for a fee of social change. With every purchase we tend to use the payments for the betterment of our society and community; to raise enough money from the support of our customers in order to invest it in safety measures for the community.</p>
